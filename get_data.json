{"name": "Introducing Double-Win: Surf Volatility to Score", "body": "\n\n\n\n\n What's the key to riding out periods of massive market fluctuations or sudden spikes in volatility? The three S'es: Stoicism, Swift response, and creative hedging Strategies. We're thrilled to introduce a Bybit Earn product that offers them all. \n\n\n Unveiling Double-Win  \n\nDouble-Win is an advanced short-term structured product that helps users preempt strong market movements in  both directions. \n\n Learn more about Double-Win   \n\nHow does it work? \n\n Double-Win is based on the concept of binary options. At expiration, users either receive a payoff if the settlement price sits outside the preset range, or nothing at all if the price falls within the range. \n\n To subscribe to a Double-Win plan, start by setting a Double-Win range based on your prediction of the price of the underlying asset. \n\n Here are the payoff scenarios of a Double-Win plan: \n\n\n\n\n\n When to use Double-Win?   \n\n\nBelow are some examples of when a Double-Win plan might be suitable: \n\n\nStay Ahead of the Curve:  Subscribe to Double-Win before the release of major indices such as CPI or LPR that may impact the market.\nFinger on the Market Pulse:  Capitalize on headline events such as Ethereum upgrades or legal decisions.\nSpeculate on Swings:  Leverage strong market volatility within your Double-Win subscription period.\nHedge Against Volatility:  Help to manage market volatility risks with preset price ranges. \n\n\n\n Key Advantages  \n\n -  Quick Settlement:  Provide a quick turnaround for your investment as Double-Win plans settle in as short as eight (8) hours.\n\n -  Diverse Preset Range:  Choose from a variety of preset ranges that give you the flexibility to tailor your strategies to market conditions. \n\n-  Unlimited Potential Returns:  Potential returns increase as the settlement price moves further away from the Double-Win range. \n\n\n\n Availability \n\n Double-Win is available on the Bybit website and app. \n\n\n Catch the wave of market volatility. Discover Double-Win on Bybit. \n\n\n"},
